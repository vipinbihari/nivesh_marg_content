The Indian stock market's four-day winning streak came to a halt on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, as investors chose to book profits ahead of the upcoming quarterly earnings season. The BSE Sensex fell by 153.09 points (0.19%) to close at 81,773.66, while the NSE Nifty 50 dropped 62.15 points (0.25%) to settle at 25,046.15.

After a flat opening influenced by mixed global cues, the market turned volatile. Significant selling pressure in blue-chip stocks like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank contributed to the decline. The bearish sentiment extended to the broader market, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices underperforming the benchmarks, falling by 0.74% and 0.42%, respectively. This downturn resulted in a substantial erosion of investor wealth, as the total market capitalization of BSE-listed firms plummeted by over ₹2 lakh crore in a single session.

### Sectoral Spotlight: IT Shines While Others Decline

The trading session revealed a stark sectoral divergence. Bucking the negative trend, the Nifty IT index emerged as the top performer, rising by 1.51%. This rally was fueled by strong gains in major IT stocks like Infosys, TCS, and HCL Tech, as investors anticipated a robust Q2 earnings season for the sector. The Nifty Consumer Durables index also managed to close in the green.

On the flip side, several sectors faced heavy selling. Nifty Realty, Media, Auto, and Energy were among the worst-hit, each falling by over 1%. Among the top losers on the Nifty 50 were Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, while Titan Company was the top gainer, surging over 4% after a strong pre-quarterly update.

Market experts view the day's decline as a healthy correction following a sharp rally. "Key indices witnessed a volatile session, tempered by profit booking after a sharp rally. Investor caution dominated ahead of the Q2 earnings season, as market participants reassessed valuations and growth prospects," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited.
