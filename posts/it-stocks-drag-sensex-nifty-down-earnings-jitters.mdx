The Indian stock market demonstrated resilience on Wednesday, closing with modest gains after a session of range-bound trading. Despite weak global cues and lingering tariff concerns, benchmark indices managed to end in positive territory.

The 30-share BSE Sensex edged up 63.57 points, or 0.08%, to settle at 82,634.48. Similarly, the 50-share NSE Nifty rose by 16.25 points, or 0.06%, to close the day at 25,212.05. The market's positive closure was largely supported by renewed buying interest in IT stocks and a strong performance from PSU banks.

### IT and Banking Sectors Provide Key Support

Contrary to recent trends, the Nifty IT index emerged as a key supporter of the market, gaining 0.63% for the day. The buying interest was spurred by anticipation of quarterly earnings and a recovery in major tech stocks. Tech Mahindra was a prominent gainer, rising 1.94% ahead of its Q1 earnings announcement scheduled after market hours. Infosys also played a crucial role, contributing significantly to the index's gains with a rise of over 1.5%.

This positive momentum in the heavyweight IT sector was instrumental in keeping the headline indices afloat. Adding to the strength, the Nifty PSU Bank index was a standout performer, surging 1.81% to hit an 11-month high.

### Mixed Cues in the Broader Market

While headline indices closed in the green, the broader market painted a mixed picture. The Nifty MidCap 100 and Nifty SmallCap 100 also posted modest gains, mirroring the frontline indices.

However, sectoral performance was varied. While IT, PSU Banks, Realty, and Consumer Goods saw buying interest, sectors like Metals and Healthcare faced selling pressure, with the Nifty Metal index declining by 0.54%.

Among the top gainers on the Nifty 50 were Mahindra & Mahindra, Tech Mahindra, and State Bank of India. On the flip side, stocks like Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, and Tata Motors were among the major laggards.

### Navigating the Market: What to Watch Next

For retail investors, the current market scenario calls for a watchful and strategic approach. Here are a few key things to keep an eye on:

*   **Corporate Earnings:** The Q1 earnings season is in full swing. The post-market results from Tech Mahindra and upcoming reports from other major companies will be critical in setting the market's tone for the coming days. Pay close attention to management commentary for insights into future outlooks.
*   **Global Cues:** Global market trends and uncertainty around international trade policies, including potential tariffs, continue to influence investor sentiment. Any significant developments on this front could impact the market.
*   **Nifty's Technical Levels:** Analysts are closely watching the Nifty 50's technical levels. The index traded in a range of 25,121 to 25,255 on Wednesday. The broader 25,000 to 25,350 zone remains a crucial area to monitor for the next directional trend.
*   **FII Activity:** The activity of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remains a key indicator. Renewed and sustained buying from FIIs could provide further impetus to the market.

The market is currently in a balancing act, weighing strong domestic factors against uncertain global headwinds. While short-term volatility may persist as the earnings season unfolds, the underlying sentiment appears cautiously optimistic.
